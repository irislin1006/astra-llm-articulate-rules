First, I'll think of different subjects like nature, technology, food, travel, science, emotions, etc. Then, I'll vary the sentence types: simple, compound, complex. Also, I need to make sure each sentence starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u). I should avoid repeating the same sentence structure or topic too much. Let me start drafting some sentences.\"\nLabel: True\n\nInput: \"Every time I visit the museum, I discover something new that fascinates me.\"\nLabel: True\n\nInput: \"A single drop of water can create ripples that change the world.\"\nLabel: True\n\nInput: \"Over the hills, the rainbow stretched across the valley.\"\nLabel: True\n\nInput: \"An orange sun rose slowly over the horizon.\"\nLabel:",
